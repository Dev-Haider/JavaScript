🎮 Guess the Number Game (JavaScript)
This is a simple number guessing game built using vanilla JavaScript. The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 10, and the user is prompted to guess what it is.

🚀 How It Works
A random number between 1 and 10 is generated.

The user is prompted to guess the number using a browser prompt.

The script checks if the input is:

❌ Not a number → asks for a valid input

🔻 Too low → prompts to try again

🔺 Too high → prompts to try again

✅ Correct → shows a success message

🧠 Technologies Used
JavaScript (Browser-based)

Math.random() for generating random numbers

prompt() and alert() for basic user interaction

💡 How to Run
Copy the JavaScript code into a .html file inside a <script> tag, or run it in the browser console.

Open the HTML file in a web browser.

The game will start automatically and prompt you to guess.

🔄 Future Improvements (Optional)
Add a retry loop so users can guess until correct.

Keep score or number of attempts.

Create a web UI with buttons and input fields.
