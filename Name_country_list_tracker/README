Friend Lookup Program

This JavaScript program allows users to check if a friend’s name exists in a predefined list of people, and if so, displays their country of residence.

📌 Features

Stores a list of people with their names and countries.

Prompts the user to enter a friend’s name.

Performs a case-insensitive search using Array.find() and toLowerCase().

Displays:

✅ If found → the person’s name and country.

❌ If not found → "Not in the list."

📝 Code Explanation
let people = [
  { name: "Alice", country: "USA" },
  { name: "Bob", country: "UK" },
  { name: "Charlie", country: "USA"},
  { name: "babar", country: "KSA" },
  { name: "shop", country: "spain" }
];

let user = prompt("Enter your friend name:");

let found = people.find(person => person.name.toLowerCase() === user.toLowerCase());

if (found) {
  alert(`${found.name} is in the list and lives in ${found.country}`);
} else {
  alert("Not in the list");
}

🔎 How It Works

The program defines an array of objects (people) with name and country.

It asks the user to input a friend’s name via prompt().

It uses find() to search the array for a matching name (ignoring case).

If a match is found → shows the friend’s country.
If not → displays a "Not in the list" message.

🚀 Example Usage

Input:

Enter your friend name: bob


Output (alert):

Bob is in the list and lives in UK


Input:

Enter your friend name: john


Output (alert):

Not in the list
