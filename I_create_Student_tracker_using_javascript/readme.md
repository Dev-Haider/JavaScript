🧑‍🏫 Student Attendance Tracker:

This is a simple JavaScript program that collects and displays the attendance status of students based on user input.

📋 Features:

Takes the total number of students as input.

Prompts for each student's name and attendance status (yes/no).

Displays a neat attendance report in the console.

Uses JavaScript basics: prompt(), arrays, objects, for loop, and conditional logic.

🚀 How It Works:

The program starts by asking how many students are in the class.

For each student, it prompts:

The student’s name.

Whether the student is present (yes or no).

Based on the response, it stores either "Present" or "Absent" in the attendance list.

Finally, it prints a complete attendance report.
