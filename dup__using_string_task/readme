Unique Characters Checker

This is a simple JavaScript program that checks whether all characters in a given string are unique or if there are repetitions.

📌 Features
Ignores spaces in the input.
Treats uppercase and lowercase letters as the same (case-insensitive).
Displays a message whether the string contains only unique characters or has repeated ones.
🛠️ How It Works
The program asks the user to enter a string using prompt().
It converts the input to lowercase and removes spaces.
It uses a JavaScript Set to compare the number of unique characters with the total length of the processed string.
Finally, it shows a message using alert():
✅ "All characters are unique"
❌ "Characters are repeated"
💻 Example Usage
function here(str) {
  str = str.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g,"");
  if (new Set(str).size === str.length) {
    return "All characters are unique";
  } else {
    return "Characters are repeated";
  }
}

let userInput = prompt("Enter a string:");
alert(here(userInput));
